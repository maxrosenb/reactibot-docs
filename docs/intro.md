# Learning React

The official (beta) React docs are the best resource for learning React:
https://beta.reactjs.org/

The official (stable) React docs still teach classes for the examples, but the concepts are still valid:

The Reactiflux "Learning Resources" page has curated links for learning JS, React, Redux, and TS:
