# Don’t Ping or DM Other Devs you Aren’t Actively Talking to
It’s very tempting to try to get more attention to your question by @-mentioning one of the high profile(or recently active) members of Reactiflux, but please don’t. They may not actually be online, they may not be able to help, and they may be in a completely different timezone–nobody likes push notifications at 3am from an impatient stranger.

Similarly, don’t DM other members without asking first. All of the same problems as @-mentioning apply, and private conversations can’t help anyone else. Your questions are likely not unique, and other people can learn from them when they’re kept public.
